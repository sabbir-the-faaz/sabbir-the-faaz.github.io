description: While searching for the purpose of my existence, I realized in the later part of my first year at university that my life would be meaningful if I could contribute to humanity through my discoveries. This realization marked the beginning of my journey into research. Initially, I worked on solid waste management to protect the environment during my early university days. However, I soon found myself drawn to the fascinating fields of AI & computer science. It has become my heartfelt desire to create something remarkable that can help humanity, change the worldâ€”something that could save lives and make people's lives easier. Here are some of my works throughout my university days
